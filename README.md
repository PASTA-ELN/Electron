React-Electron branch of the jamDB framework. The software is intended to run as native code on Linux/Windows/osX. This software is in alpha-stage.

There is documentation (e.g. installation instructions) in the wiki-section of the python-branch. In the python-branch go to the wiki-section (left-sidebar), which is a separate git-repro (pushed from the documentation folder.)
